# chuckfact
Production build of react chuckfact.com website using chucknorris.io API
You can look at the relevant REACT source from the development build in the src folder 
Not for profit, not related to or in any way endorsed by Chuck Norris, just a fan demonstrating some front end skills using an api that is free. 

Uses REACT-BOOTSTRAP
Features:
1. Light/Dark theme
2. Responsive Design (rounded picture highlights it, but bootstrap breakpoints are used obviously)
3. Accessibility - alt tags/contrast
4. Uses Axios to pull from the chucknorris.io api
5. Searches api, and uses an RNG to pick a value from the returned array
6. Uses an imported toggle react component (code is about teamwork and using tools)
7. Chuck Norris Facts
8. Dark theme Color palette inspired largely by VS Code
9. Is/will be deployed using vercel cloud PaaS

So basically, shows I can do front end work. Also, and perhaps more importantly, I like Invasion USA and Delta Force 2. A lot.

Have a nice day!
Mike

P.S. Special thanks to the awesome guy who does the chucknorris api

P.P.S Don't use this for profit, claim credit (my name is on the website), or anything bad.
